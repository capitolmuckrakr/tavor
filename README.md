# Tavor [![GoDoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/zimmski/tavor?status.png)](https://godoc.org/github.com/zimmski/tavor) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/zimmski/tavor.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/zimmski/tavor)

Tavor ([Sindarin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sindarin) for "woodpecker") is a fuzzing and delta-debugging platform.

## Can I make feature requests, report bugs and problems?

Sure, just submit an [issue via the project tracker](https://github.com/zimmski/tavor/issues/new) and I will see what I can do. Please note that I do not guarantee to implement anything soon and bugs and problems are more important to me than new features. If you need something implemented or fixed right away you can contact me via mail <mz@nethead.at> to do contract work for you.
