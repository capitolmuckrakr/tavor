# Tavor [![GoDoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/zimmski/tavor?status.png)](https://godoc.org/github.com/zimmski/tavor) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/zimmski/tavor.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/zimmski/tavor)

Tavor ([Sindarin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sindarin) for "woodpecker") is a fuzzing and delta-debugging platform.

## How do I build Tavor?<a name="build"/>

Tavor provides [precompiled 64 bit Linux binaries](#precompiled). Other platforms are currently not supported, but might work. Please have a look at the [feature request section](#feature-request) if you need them to work or you want more binaries.

If you do not want to use the [precompiled binaries](#precompiled) but instead want to compile Tavor from scratch, just follow the these steps (NOTE: All steps must execute without any errors):

1. Install and configure Go.

	At least version 1.3 must be used. Your distribution will most definitely have some packages or you can be brave and just install it yourself. Have a look at [the official documentation](http://golang.org/doc/install). Good luck!

2. Go-get Tavor

	```bash
	go get -t -v github.com/zimmski/tavor
	```

3. Install dependencies

	```bash
	cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/zimmski/tavor
	make dependencies
	```

3. Compile

	```bash
	cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/zimmski/tavor
	make install
	```

4. Run tests

	```bash
	cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/zimmski/tavor
	make test
	```

You now have a binary "tavor" in your GOPATH/bin (or if set GOBIN folder) folder which can be used without any further actions.

## Where are the precompiled binaries?<a name="precompiled"/>

You can find all precompiled binaries on the [release page](https://github.com/zimmski/tavor/releases). The binaries are packed into archives that currently only hold the Tavor binary itself.

### Bash Completion

If you like Bash Completion for Tavor make sure that you have Bash Completion installed and then copy the [bash completion Tavor script](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zimmski/tavor/master/bin/tavor-bash_completion.sh) into your Bash Completion folder.

```bash
mkdir -p $HOME/.bash_completion
wget -P $HOME/.bash_completion https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zimmski/tavor/master/bin/tavor-bash_completion.sh
. ~/.bashrc
```

Bash Completion for Tavor should now be working. If not, one reason could be that your distribution does not include user defined Bash Completion scripts in .bashrc so just add it to your .bashrc:

```bash
echo ". ~/.bash_completion/tavor-bash_completion.sh" >> ~/.bashrc
. ~/.bashrc
```

## Can I make feature requests, report bugs and problems?<a name="feature-request"/>

Sure, just submit an [issue via the project tracker](https://github.com/zimmski/tavor/issues/new) and I will see what I can do. Please note that I do not guarantee to implement anything soon and bugs and problems are more important to me than new features. If you need something implemented or fixed right away you can contact me via mail <mz@nethead.at> to do contract work for you.
